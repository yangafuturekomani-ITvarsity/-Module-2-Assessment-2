                    <h3>NANDOS</h3>
                    <P>The restaurant was founded in 1987 in the Johannesburg suburb Rosettenville, by Mozambique-born Fernando Duarte and South African-born Robert Brozin. Upon visiting a Colonial Portuguese-African[1] takeaway named Chickenland, and trying the chicken with peri peri (a sauce that was first developed in nearby Mozambique and further refined in South Africa before being exported to other Portuguese territories and mainland Portugal) they bought the restaurant for about R80,000 rand (equivalent of about £25,000 at the time).[2] They renamed the restaurant Nando's after Fernando's first born son. By 1989, the restaurant had three outlets in Johannesburg and one in Portugal.[3][2] Capricorn Ventures International acquired the chain in 1992.[4] As of 2017, there were over 1,000 Nando's branches in 35 countries</P>
                    <p>In 2010, Advertising Age magazine named Nando's one of the world's top 30 hottest marketing brands alongside Tata Nano, MTN and Natura.[6] During the same year, the success of Nando’s in the U.K. led The Guardian to write that Nando's is a modern restaurant brand that has “changed the face of British fast food”.[7] In 2012 Nando's 1000th store worldwide opened.[8] As of July 2014 the Nando's restaurant group was ultimately owned by South African businessman Dick Enthoven and his family. Enthoven's son, Robby Enthoven who took over running the restaurants in 1993, was responsible for expanding the Nando's chain in the United Kingdom</p>
                    <p>Fernando Duarte and his friend Robert Brozin are the founders of the first Nando's restaurant bought a joint previously called "ChickenLand" and renamed it Nando's. They opened it in 1987.[2][12][13] By 2018, there were 340 Nando's restaurants in the country</p>
