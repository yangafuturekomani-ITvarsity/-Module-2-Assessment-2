                    <h3>MOVIE DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    <p>The Equalizer is a 2014 American vigilante action thriller film directed by Antoine Fuqua, loosely based on the 1980s TV series of the same name. Written by Richard Wenk, it stars Denzel Washington, Marton Csokas, Chloë Grace Moretz, David Harbour, Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo. The film focuses on a former US Marine turned Defense Intelligence Agency officer who reluctantly returns to action to protect a teenage sex worker from members of the Russian mafia.

Principal photography began in June 2013 in Massachusetts. It was the first film to have Village Roadshow Pictures co-finance the deal with Sony Pictures since Saving Silverman in 2001, which began with Fortress (1992).

The Equalizer had its world premiere at 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2014, and was released worldwide on September 26, 2014 in conventional and IMAX theaters. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the visual style, acting, soundtrack and action sequences but criticized its violence and plot. Nonetheless, it became a commercial success with a worldwide gross of over $192 million on a production budget of $73 million.

A sequel was released on July 20, 2018, with Washington, Wenk and Fuqua returning.</p>
