                    <P>Nedbank Group is a financial services group in South Africa offering wholesale and retail banking services as well as insurance, asset management, and wealth management. Nedbank Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nedbank Group.

Outside Africa, Nedbank have offices to provide international financial services for Africa-based clients in Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates.

                    <P>The bank was founded in 1888 in Amsterdam as the Nederlandsche Bank en Credietvereeniging voor Zuid-Afrika ("Dutch Bank and Credit Union for South Africa"). In the same year, the bank opened an office in Church Street, Pretoria, South Africa. In 1903, the company was renamed to Nederlandsche Bank voor Zuid-Afrika ("Dutch Bank for South Africa"). In 1906, the bank expanded and an office in London was opened. The bank split in 1951, renaming its South African counterpart as Nederlandse Bank in Suid-Afrika/Netherlands Bank of South Africa (NBSA). In 1969, the number of South African shareholders increased significantly and the company became 100% South African-owned after the Bank Mees and Hope sold 20% of its shares. The South African counterpart was completely independent. The Dutch counterpart of the bank no longer exists. Syfrets SA and Boland Bank listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in 1969. In 1971, NBSA changed its name to Nedbank. Nedbank Group formed from the merger of Syfrets SA, Union Acceptances and Nedbank in 1973. In 1986, Old Mutual became the major shareholder (53%) of Nedbank.</P>
