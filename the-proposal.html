                    <h3>MOVIE DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    <p>The Proposal is a 2009 American romantic comedy film directed by Anne Fletcher and written by Peter Chiarelli. It stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds with Betty White, Mary Steenburgen, and Craig T. Nelson. The plot centers on a Canadian executive who learns that she may face deportation from the U.S. because of her expired visa. Determined to retain her position as editor-in-chief of a publishing house, she convinces her assistant to temporarily act as her fiancé.

Development began in 2005, when Chiarelli wrote the script. Principal filming occurred over a period of two months from March to May 2008. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized its screenplay but praised the chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds. It was a box office success, grossing over $317 million worldwide, and becoming the 20th highest-grossing film of 2009. Bullock was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.</p>
