                    <h3>MOVIE DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    <p>Sausage Party is a 2016 adult computer-animated comedy film directed by Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan and written by Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg from a story by Rogen, Goldberg, and Jonah Hill. A parody of Disney and Pixar films,[9] the film follows an anthropomorphic sausage who lives in a supermarket and discovers the truth about his existence. He goes on a journey with his friends to escape their fate while also facing a psychopathic douche who wants to kill him. The film's animation was handled by Canada-based Nitrogen Studios.[5]

It is the first 3D computer-animated film to be rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America.[10][11][12] The film's rough cut premiered on March 14, 2016 at South by Southwest, followed by its general theatrical release in the United States and Canada on August 12, 2016 by Sony Pictures Releasing.[13]

The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised its humor and screenplay. It was a box-office success, grossing $140.7 million against a budget of $19 million and surpassed South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999) as the highest-grossing R-rated animated film of all time.</p>
